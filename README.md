Codelabs management & hosting tools.
See [claat](claat) directory for detailed description of the `claat` command
line tool.

Codelabs can be authored in Google Docs, using some simple formatting conventions. 
In the near future, we're also planning to add codelab authoring via markdown syntax.
This repo provides the tools necessary to author, generate, and serve your own codelabs.

If you're interested in authoring codelabs, join [this group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codelab-authors),
