Codelabs management &amp; hosting tools

Codelabs can be authored in Google Docs, using some simple formatting conventions. 
In the near future, we're also planning to add codelab authoring via markdown syntax.
This repo provides the tools necessary to author, generate, and serve your own codelabs.

If you're interested in authoring codelabs, join [this group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codelab-authors),
which connects you with other authors and provides access to the 
[doc formatting rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18dnMdUJQaGKY1Tit_-fO1YOpOpAbA4hh0YDXQlCEjvA/edit?ts=574ec5d9).
